        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large felid of the genus Panthera native mainly to Africa. <br>
             It has a muscular,
            deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and
            a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane. <br>
             With a
            typical head-to-body length of 184 to 208 cm (72 to 82 in) they are larger than females at 160 to 184 cm (63 to
            72 in). <br>
              It is a social species, forming groups called prides. <br> A lion pride consists of a few adult males,
            related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. <br>
             The
            lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known
            to hunt humans, the species typically does not. <br>

    <P>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large felid of the genus Panthera native mainly to Africa. It has a muscular,
        deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and
        a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane. With a
        typical head-to-body length of 184 to 208 cm (72 to 82 in) they are larger than females at 160 to 184 cm (63 to
        72 in). It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of a few adult males,
        related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The
        lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known
        to hunt humans, the species typically does not.
        Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal
        than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it
        adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa,
        Southeast Europe, and Western and South Asia,
        but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It
        has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red
        List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion
        populations are untenable outside designated
        protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with
        humans are the greatest causes for concern.
        One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in
        sculptures and paintings, on national flags,
        and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire
        and have been a key species sought for exhibition
        in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent
        in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in
        virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.

    <H2>Etymology</H2>
    <P>
        The word 'lion' is derived from Latin: leo[4] and Ancient Greek: λέων (leon).[5] The word lavi (Hebrew: לָבִיא‎)
        may also be related.[6] The generic name
        Panthera is traceable to the classical Latin word 'panthēra' and the ancient Greek word πάνθηρ 'panther'.[7]
        Panthera is phonetically similar to the Sanskrit
        word पाण्डर pând-ara meaning 'pale yellow, whitish, white'.[8]
    </P>
    <H2>Taxonomy</H2>
    <P>Felis leo was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the lion in his work Systema
        Naturae.[3] The genus name Panthera was coined
        by Lorenz Oken in 1816.[13] Between the mid-18th and mid-20th centuries, 26 lion specimens were described and
        proposed as subspecies, of which 11 were recognised
        as valid in 2005.[1] They were distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and skins.[14]

    </P>
    <H3>Subspecies</H3>
    <P>In the 19th and 20th centuries, several lion type specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, with about
        a dozen recognised as valid
        taxa until 2017.[1] Between 2008 and 2016, IUCN Red List assessors used only two subspecific names: P. l. leo
        for African lion populations,
        and P. l. persica for the Asiatic lion population.[2][15][16] In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the
        Cat Specialist Group revised
        lion taxonomy, and recognises two subspecies based on results of several phylogeographic studies on lion
        evolution, namely:[17]

        P. l. leo (Linnaeus, 1758) − the nominate lion subspecies includes the Asiatic lion, the regionally extinct
        Barbary lion, and lion
        populations in West and northern parts of Central Africa.[17] Synonyms include P. l. persica (Meyer, 1826), P.
        l. senegalensis (Meyer, 1826),
        P. l. kamptzi (Matschie, 1900), and P. l. azandica (Allen, 1924).[1] Multiple authors referred to it as
        'northern lion' and 'northern subspecies'.[18][19]
        P. l. melanochaita (Smith, 1842) − includes the extinct Cape lion and lion populations in East and Southern
        African regions.[17] Synonyms include
        P. l. somaliensis (Noack 1891), P. l. massaica (Neumann, 1900), P. l. sabakiensis (Lönnberg, 1910), P. l.
        bleyenberghi (Lönnberg, 1914), P. l.
        roosevelti (Heller, 1914), P. l. nyanzae (Heller, 1914), P. l. hollisteri (Allen, 1924), P. l. krugeri (Roberts,
        1929), P. l. vernayi (Roberts, 1948),
        and P. l. webbiensis (Zukowsky, 1964).[1][14] It has been referred to as 'southern subspecies' and 'southern
        lion'.[19]
        Lion samples from some parts of the Ethiopian Highlands cluster genetically with those from Cameroon and Chad,
        while lions from other areas of
        Ethiopia cluster with samples from East Africa. Researchers therefore assume Ethiopia is a contact zone between
        the two subspecies.[20] Genome-wide
        data of a wild-born historical lion sample from Sudan showed that it clustered with P. l. leo in mtDNA-based
        phylogenies, but with a high affinity to
        P. l. melanochaita. This result suggested that the taxonomic position of lions in Central Africa may require
        revision.[21]
    </P>
    <H3>Fossil records</H3>
    <P>Other lion subspecies or sister species to the modern lion existed in prehistoric times:[22]

        P. l. sinhaleyus was a fossil carnassial excavated in Sri Lanka, which was attributed to a lion. It is thought
        to have become extinct around 39,000 years ago.[23]
        P. leo fossilis was larger than the modern lion and lived in the Middle Pleistocene. Bone fragments were
        excavated in caves in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Czech Republic.[24][25]
        P. spelaea, or the cave lion, lived in Eurasia and Beringia during the Late Pleistocene. It became extinct due
        to climate warming or human expansion latest by 11,900 years ago.[26] Bone fragments excavated in European,
        North Asian, Canadian and Alaskan caves indicate that it ranged from Europe across Siberia into western
        Alaska.[27] It likely derived from P. fossilis,[28] and was genetically isolated and highly distinct from the
        modern lion in Africa and Eurasia.[29][28] It is depicted in Paleolithic cave paintings, ivory carvings, and
        clay busts.[30]
        P. atrox, or the American lion, ranged in the Americas from Canada to possibly Patagonia.[31] It arose when a
        cave lion population in Beringia became isolated south of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet about 370,000 years
        ago.[32][33] A fossil from Edmonton dates to 11,355 ± 55 years ago.[34]
    </P>
    <H3>Evolution</H3>
    <P>The Panthera lineage is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the Felidae around
        9.32 to 4.47 million years ago to 11.75 to
        0.97 million years ago,[9][35][36] and the geographic origin of the genus is most likely northern Central
        Asia.[37] Results of analyses differ in the
        phylogenetic relationship of the lion; it was thought to form a sister group with the jaguar (P. onca) that
        diverged 3.46 to 1.22 million years ago,[9] but also
        with the leopard (P. pardus) that diverged 3.1 to 1.95 million years ago[11][12] to 4.32 to 0.02 million years
        ago. Hybridisation between lion and snow leopard
        (P. uncia) ancestors possibly continued until about 2.1 million years ago.[36] The lion-leopard clade was
        distributed in the Asian and African Palearctic since
        at least the early Pliocene.[37] The earliest fossils recognisable as lions were found at Olduvai Gorge in
        Tanzania and are estimated to be up to 2 million
        years old.[35]
    </P>

    <P>Estimates for the divergence time of the modern and cave lion lineages range from 529,000 to 392,000 years ago
        based on mutation rate per generation time of the
        modern lion. There is no evidence for gene flow between the two lineages, indicating that they did not share the
        same geographic area.[21] The Eurasian and
        American cave lions became extinct at the end of the last glacial period without mitochondrial descendants on
        other continents.[29][38][39] The modern lion was
        probably widely distributed in Africa during the Middle Pleistocene and started to diverge in sub-Saharan Africa
        during the Late Pleistocene. Lion populations in
        East and Southern Africa became separated from populations in West and North Africa when the equatorial
        rainforest expanded 183,500 to 81,800 years ago.[40]
        They shared a common ancestor probably between 98,000 and 52,000 years ago.[21] Due to the expansion of the
        Sahara between 83,100 and 26,600 years ago, lion
        populations in West and North Africa became separated. As the rainforest decreased and thus gave rise to more
        open habitats, lions moved from West to Central
        Africa. Lions from North Africa dispersed to southern Europe and Asia between 38,800 and 8,300 years ago.[40]
    </P>

    <P>Extinction of lions in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East interrupted gene flow between lion
        populations in Asia and Africa. Genetic evidence
        revealed numerous mutations in lion samples from East and Southern Africa, which indicates that this group has a
        longer evolutionary history than genetically
        iverse lion samples from Asia and West and Central Africa.[41] A whole genome-wide sequence of lion samples
        showed that samples from West Africa shared alleles
        with samples from Southern Africa, and samples from Central Africa shared alleles with samples from Asia. This
        phenomenon indicates that Central Africa was a
        melting pot of lion populations after they had become isolated, possibly migrating through corridors in the Nile
        Basin during the early Holocene.[21]
