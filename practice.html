        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large felid of the genus Panthera native mainly to Africa. 
            It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
             It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane.
              With a typical head-to-body length of 184 to 208 cm (72 to 82 in) they are larger than females at 160 to 184 cm (63 to 72 in).
               It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. 
               Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. 
               The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and 
               have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.
        </p>
      
        <p>Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests.
             It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. 
             During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, and Western and South Asia, but it has been 
             reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red
              List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s.
               Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, 
               habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
        </p>
        <p>One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings,
             on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and 
             have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of 
             lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.

        <h2>Etymology</h2><hr>
        <p>
            The word 'lion' is derived from Latin: leo[4] and Ancient Greek: λέων (leon).[5]
             The word lavi (Hebrew: לָבִיא‎) may also be related.[6]
              The generic name Panthera is traceable to the classical Latin word 'panthēra' and the ancient Greek word πάνθηρ 'panther'.
              [7] Panthera is phonetically similar to the Sanskrit word पाण्डर pând-ara meaning 'pale yellow, whitish, white'.[8]

        <h2>Taxonomy</h2><hr>
        <p id="rit">Felis leo was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the lion in his work Systema Naturae.
            [3] The genus name Panthera was coined by Lorenz Oken in 1816.[13] Between the mid-18th and mid-20th centuries, 
            26 lion specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, of which 11 were recognised as valid in 2005.[1] 
            They were distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and skins.[14]
        </p>
        <h3>Subspecies</h3>
        <p>
            In the 19th and 20th centuries, several lion type specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, with about a dozen recognised 
            as valid taxa until 2017.[1] Between 2008 and 2016, IUCN Red List assessors used only two subspecific names: P. l. leo for African lion
             populations, and P. l. persica for the Asiatic lion population.[2][15][16] In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat 
             Specialist Group revised lion taxonomy, and recognises two subspecies based on results of several phylogeographic studies on lion evolution, namely:[17]
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                P. l. leo (Linnaeus, 1758) − the nominate lion subspecies includes the Asiatic lion, the regionally extinct Barbary lion, <br>
                and lion populations in West and northern parts of Central Africa.[17] Synonyms include P. l. persica (Meyer, 1826), P. l. <br>
                 senegalensis (Meyer, 1826), P. l. kamptzi (Matschie, 1900), and P. l. azandica (Allen, 1924).[1] Multiple authors referred to it as <br>
                 'northern lion' and 'northern subspecies'.[18][19]
            </li>
            <li>
                P. l. melanochaita (Smith, 1842) − includes the extinct Cape lion and lion populations in East and Southern African regions.<br>
                [17] Synonyms include P. l. somaliensis (Noack 1891), P. l. massaica (Neumann, 1900), P. l. sabakiensis (Lönnberg, 1910),<br>
                 P. l. bleyenberghi (Lönnberg, 1914), P. l. roosevelti (Heller, 1914), P. l. nyanzae (Heller, 1914), P. l. hollisteri (Allen, 1924),<br>
                  P. l. krugeri (Roberts, 1929), P. l. vernayi (Roberts, 1948), and P. l. webbiensis (Zukowsky, 1964).[1][14] It has been referred to as <br>
                  'southern subspecies' and 'southern lion'.[19]
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Lion samples from some parts of the Ethiopian Highlands cluster genetically with those from Cameroon and Chad, 
            while lions from other areas of Ethiopia cluster with samples from East Africa. Researchers therefore assume Ethiopia is
             a contact zone between the two subspecies.[20] Genome-wide data of a wild-born historical lion sample from Sudan showed that
             it clustered with P. l. leo in mtDNA-based phylogenies, but with a high affinity to P. l. melanochaita. This result suggested 
             that the taxonomic position of lions in Central Africa may require revision.[21]

        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
                <p id="descp" class="descp1">
                    The lion is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears. Its fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey,
                    owish red and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, 
                      although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts. The lion is the only member of the cat family that displays obvious sexual dimorphism.
                      Males have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows downwards and backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The mane is typically 
                      brownish and tinged with yellow, rust and black hairs.[47][48]</p>

                <p id="descp" class="descp2"> The tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that in some lions conceals an approximately 5 mm (0.20 in)-long, hard "spine" or "spur" 
                   that is formed from the final, fused sections of tail bone. The functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent at birth and develops
                   at around 5+1⁄2 months of age. It is readily identifiable by the age of seven months.[49]</p>

                <p id="descp" class="descp3"> Of the living felid species, the lion is rivaled only by the tiger in length, weight, and height at the shoulder.
                   [50] Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, 
                   and has a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the amount of skull 
                   variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.[51][52]
