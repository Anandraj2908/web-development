        Keechaka Vadham (The Extermination of Keechaka) is an Indian 
        silent film produced, directed, filmed and edited by R. 
        Nataraja Mudaliar (pictured), and released in the late 1910s.
         No print of it is known to survive. The first Tamil film and 
         the first film to be made in South India, it was shot in about
          five weeks at Mudaliar's production house, India Film Company.
           The screenplay by C. Rangavadivelu is based on an episode from 
           the Virata Parva segment of the Hindu epic Mahabharata, focusing 
           on Keechaka's attempts to woo Draupadi. The film stars Raju Mudaliar
            and Jeevarathnam as the central characters. Keechaka Vadham was 
            commercially successful and received positive critical feedback. 
            The film's success prompted the director to make a series of similar
            cal films that laid the foundation for the South Indian cinema 
            industry. His works were an inspiration to other filmmakers, 
            including Raghupathi Surya Prakasa and J. C. Daniel.
